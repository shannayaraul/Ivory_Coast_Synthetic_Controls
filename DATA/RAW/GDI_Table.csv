,Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Gender Development Index: Ratio of female to male HDI values. See Technical note 3 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2023_technical_notes.pdf for details on how the Gender Development Index is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Gender Development Index groups: Countries are divided into five groups by absolute deviation from gender parity in HDI values. Group 1 comprises countries with high equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of less than 2.5 percent), group 2 comprises countries with medium to high equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of 2.55 percent), group 3 comprises countries with medium equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of 57.5 percent), group 4 comprises countries with medium to low equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of 7.510 percent) and group 5 comprises countries with low equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation from gender parity of more than 10 percent).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Human Development Index (HDI): A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human developmenta long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. See Technical note 1 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2023_technical_notes.pdf for details on how the HDI is calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Life expectancy at birth: Number of years a newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth stay the same throughout the infants life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Expected years of schooling: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the childs life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Mean years of schooling: Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from educational attainment levels using official durations of each level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Estimated gross national income per capita: Derived from the ratio of female to male wages, female and male shares of economically active population and gross national income (in 2017 purchasing power parity terms). See Technical note 3 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2023_technical_notes.pdf for details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
