## Theme:
 "Neocolonial Institutions and Gold Mining Mismanagement in Ivory Coast: Effects on Economic Development 
"

 ## Featuring: 
Shannaya Raul and Charlotte Kouakou

 ## Overview
 This project aims to understand how the 2014 revised mining code (which focus mainly on gold mining) fostered economic development in Ivory Coast (IC). The code aimed at drawing investments to the country's gold mining industry as its main driver of development. Since this revision, gold extraction has contributed to approximately 5% of the country's GDP, generating about $2.12 billion in exports.

 The project used a synthetic ontrols analysis to compare treated Ivory Coast (with the revised code and investments in gold mining), and a control IC without the treatment, using Human Development Index (HDI) as an indicator. For this end, a donor pool of countries with similar economic characteristics as the IC, excluding gold mining, were used. The analysis looked at the timeline between 2000 and 2022, assuming that synthetic IC is comparable to actual IC in all relevant dimensions except for the revision of the code and investments in gold extraction, and that absent the revision of the mining code and heavy investments in gold mining synthetic IC's development would be less than that of treated IC.
 
Our findings tell no significant difference in treated IC's HDI. In fact, for a long time, synthetic IC does better economically compared to treated IC, until both catch up and walk on similar trends. This analysis helps us conclude that investments in the extractive industry in IC has not been able to lift the country out of poverty on a microlevel, which suggests gaps in income distribution, elitistic accumulation of resources, and corporate social responsibility.
